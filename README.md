In this project we explore the Solow growth model with human capital as an improved measure of economic growth across countries

The motivation to study growth across countries stems from the field of development economics. Seeking to understand the underlying factors driving growth across countries is crucial for policy-making, especially when the aim is to reduce inequalities. However, studying growth using only two input factors (capital and labor), as in the standard Solow Growth Model, neglects crucial heterogeneous and country-specific factors such as the added productivty that is gained from educating and training workers. Based on this argumentation, Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992) have presented an extension of the standard Solow Growth Model to include human capital. Importantly, human capital (H) is strictly tied to workers (L) as education and training cannot be separated from an individual. This implies that any income share earned by human capital, naturally goes to workers. Finally, it is assumed that increases in physical capital lead to an increase in GDP and that subsequently, a fraction of this GDP growth is invested in human capital, which will provide an additional return. In turn, aggregate GDP growth can be pushed beyond the limits of the steady state in the standard capital-labor model.

In short, the extended model provides three potential sources of growth vs only 2 in the standard model:

increase in physical capital per worker
increase in human capital per worker
improved technology
